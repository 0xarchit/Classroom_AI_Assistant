# AI Teaching Assistant System

This project integrates emotion detection, voice-to-text, AI processing, and text-to-voice capabilities into a web-based teaching assistant system. Powered by FastAPI and LLaMA 3.1 3B, it bridges the gap between human emotions and AI responses, creating a real-time emotion-driven interaction experience.

## Problem Statement:
Modern classrooms lack real-time, interactive tools to address diverse student needs and keep them engaged. The objective is to create a multimodal AI assistant that:

- Accepts and processes text and voice queries from students in real-time.
- Provides contextual responses, including textual explanations, charts, and visual aids.
- Detects disengagement or confusion using facial expression analysis.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection**: Detects user's facial emotions in real-time using DeepFace and OpenCV
- **Voice-to-Text**: Converts user's speech to text for natural language input
- **AI Processing**: Processes user queries with emotion-aware AI responses
- **Image Search**: Finds relevant images based on contextual prompts
- **Text-to-Voice**: Converts AI responses to speech with emotion-appropriate voice synthesis
- **Web Interface**: Modern UI built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript

## System Architecture

### Backend
- FastAPI server with asynchronous WebSocket implementation
- Connection management system handling multiple concurrent users
- Integration of multiple AI components
- Efficient state tracking of user emotions, interactions, and responses
- Asynchronous processing for better performance

### Frontend
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS
- Real-time WebSocket communication for seamless interactions
- Camera integration for emotion detection
- Dynamic UI updates based on emotion detection
- Speech recognition using Web Speech API

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam for emotion detection
- Microphone for voice input
- Internet connection for AI processing and image search

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env` (or create a new `.env` file)
   - Add your RapidAPI key for image search
   - Configure any other environment variables as needed
   
   Example `.env` file:
   ```
   RAPIDAPI_KEY="your_rapidapi_key_here"
   RAPIDAPI_HOST="real-time-image-search.p.rapidapi.com"
   AI_MODEL_URL="http://localhost:12345/v1/chat/completions"
   ```

4. Run the server:
   ```
   python server.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```


## Troubleshooting

- If the camera doesn't work, check browser permissions
- If speech recognition fails, ensure your microphone is working
- If the server fails to start, check if port 8000 is available

## Future Goals

As we continue to develop this AI Classroom Teaching Assistant System, we plan to implement several enhancements to make the experience even more immersive and effective:

### Near-Term Enhancements
- **Emotion-Adaptive Voice Generation**: Integration of a specialized ML model for human-like voice generation that dynamically adapts tone, pitch, and speaking style based on detected student emotions
- **AI Image Generation**: Implementation of diffusion models to create custom educational illustrations and diagrams in real-time based on the educational content being discussed
- **Multi-Student Emotion Tracking**: Ability to simultaneously track and respond to multiple students emotional states in classroom settings
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: Development of student profiles that track engagement patterns and learning preferences to customize future interactions
- **Extended Language Support**: Integration of multilingual capabilities for global classroom deployment

### Long-Term Vision
- **AR/VR Integration**: Creation of immersive educational experiences with 3D visualizations of complex concepts
- **Collaborative Learning Features**: Facilitation of group activities and peer-to-peer learning with AI moderation
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive insights for educators about student engagement, emotional patterns, and learning progress
